I just got word from the boss. 
A manufacturing problem discovered at our Maryiand factory will lead to an immediate recall of all T-20 and T-21 model toasters our company sold in the past year.

Hal Anderson [10:12 A.M.]
I heard about that issue earier this morning, 
A recall is going to be a huge undertaking. 
We'll have to post a notice in some major newspapers.

Oliver Lee [10:14 A.M.]
That's right. And we'll also have to put the same information on our Web site.

Hal Anderson [10:16 A.M.]
That would be the best way to reach our customers abroad. 
Katie, can you draft an announcement if I forward you all of the details?

Katie Ford [10:19 A.M.]
Of course. 
I'll put it together as quickly as I can and get a list of press contacts from marketing.

Gina Adenan  [10:22 A.M.]
Thanks, Katie. Oiver
As you are running the call center, you'll need to train your staff to handle inquiries regarding the recall, There will be a lot of calls from the public, I'm sure.

Oliver Lee  [10:25 A.M.]
I'll get right on it
We dealt with a similar issue three years ago, so I know what needs to be done.

Gina Adenan [10:28 A.M] 
Okay, thanks everyone.
It sounds like we should be able to handle everything.
